# Multi-Task-Image-Classification-with-Face-and-Emotion-Recognition

Implemented a comprehensive Computer Vision project involving the creation of a custom image dataset,
preprocessing using OpenCV, and building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from scratch.
The primary objective was to simultaneously perform Face Recognition and Emotion Recognition tasks using a single model.
